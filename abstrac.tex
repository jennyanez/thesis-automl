\section*{Abstract}
We live in a world in which large amounts of data stored in different systems are generated, and the challenge is to convert this data into useful information for decision making. One technique for extracting valuable information from large amounts of data is Machine Learning, which focuses on developing models and algorithms that allow computers to learn from data without being cleanly programmed to do so. To effectively implement these techniques, human intervention is required, and Automation of Machine Learning (AutoML) has been developed as a solution to simplify and speed up this process. For this, there are numerous tools, such as KNIME, that allow the implementation of AutoML through different nodes. \citep{Carrazana2022} develops a component dedicated to this task, specifically for preprocessing in classification tasks. However, there were pending tasks, such as the optimization of hyperparameters and the automation of tasks in the data transformation phase, which are implemented in this work.
